![Kotlin's logo][1]

At [OrgSync][2], we sometimes present things that interest us to the rest of
the team. We usually give these talks over lunch, so we call them "Lunch &
Learns". A common topic for Lunch & Learns is programming languages. We call
these our "Better Know a Language" series. Today I presented my Lunch & Learn,
*Better Know a Language: Kotlin*. It covered [Kotlin][3], an object-oriented
programming language for the JVM and JavaScript.

For the first time ever, we broadcast our Lunch & Learn live as a Hangout on
Air. The presentation is now available as [a YouTube video][5]. Also [the
slides][6] are available on this site.
