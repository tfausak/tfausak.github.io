title: Announcing Haddock Dingus, a tool for previewing Haddock markup
---

I don't write Haddock markup all that often.
It's similar to Markdown but different in a few ways that I always forget.
I've often wanted a web-based tool for previewing what some Haddock will look like.
Over the weekend I put one together.
I call it the [Haddock Dingus][1], after the original [Markdown Dingus][2].
It's pretty simple: Input some Haddock, click "Submit", and see what the output HTML looks like.
Give it a whirl and let me know what you think!
