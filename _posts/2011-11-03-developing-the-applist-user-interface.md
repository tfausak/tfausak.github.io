title: Developing the Applist User Interface
---

Yesterday, [I introduced a new feature][1] I worked on this week:
[Famigo Applists][2]. Today, I'll talk about developing the user
interface and backend for creating applists.

## Frontend

Creating applists relies on easily finding apps and adding them to
the list. Hunting for each app in the Android Market and pasting
its URL into a text box is no fun.

I leveraged our database of over 30,000 apps to provide an autocomplete
dropdown for the user. Start typing the name of an app, then select
it from the dropdown. Nothing could be simpler!

To implement it, I turned to [jQuery UI][3] since [jQuery][4] is
my JavaScript library of choice. Plus, jQuery UI has a built-in
[autocomplete widget][5] that does everything I need. It's highly
configurable, to boot.

I set it up with a customized list of suggestions, a hook on
selection, and a remote data source (more on that later). Two
functions handle all the customization: `autocomplete_render` creates
suggestions, and `autocomplete_select` creates a DOM element when
a suggestion is selected.

It's import to create good suggestions in `autocomplete_render` so
that users can pick an app with confidence. (Try searching for
["angry birds"][6], for example.) Including the icon, developer,
and platform (Android or iOS) along with the app name should help
the user pick the right app.

{% highlight javascript %}
function autocomplete_render (ul, item) {
    return $('<li/>')
        .data('item.autocomplete', item)
        .append($('a/>')
            .append($('<img/>')
                .addClass('platform')
                .attr('src', item.platform))
            .append($('<img/>')
                .addClass('icon')
                .attr('src', item.icon))
            .append($('<span/>')
                .addClass('name')
                .html(item.name))
            .append($('<span/>')
                .addClass('developer')
                .html(item.developer)))
        .appendTo(ul);
};
{% endhighlight %}

Following the template on the Famigo shared sandbox seemed
like a good idea for creating DOM elements in `autocomplete_select`.
Each element would have all the same information as the dropdown,
but it would look much prettier.

A couple other small things need to be handled in this function.
The element needs to be added to the top of the applist, and the
autocomplete box needs to be cleared and re-focused so the user can
add another app.

{% highlight javascript %}
function autocomplete_select (event, ui) {
    $('<li/>')
        .append($('<img/>')
            .addClass('platform')
            .attr('src', ui.item.platform))
        .append($('<img/>')
            .addClass('icon')
            .attr('src', ui.item.icon))
        .append($('<div/>')
            .addClass('name')
            .html(ui.item.name))
        .append($('<div/>')
            .addClass('developer')
            .html(ui.item.developer))
        .hide()
        .prependTo('#list')
        .slideDown();
    $(this).focus().val('');
    return false;
}
{% endhighlight %}

All that's left is enable the autocompletion widget and set it up
to use the custom functions.

{% highlight javascript %}
$('#autocomplete').autocomplete({
    select: autocomplete_select,
    source: '/autocomplete/'
}).data('autocomplete')._renderItem = autocomplete_render;
{% endhighlight %}

## Backend

The backend just suggests apps based on a search query and returns
JSON results. That's pretty easy. The results are prime candidates
for caching, too.

At Famigo, our Django backend is powered by [MongoEngine][9], and
we use [pysolr][10] for searching. Once Django routes the URL, the
view normalizes the query and searches Solr. Then the results are
transformed into MongoEngine references, formatted, and returned
as JSON.

{% highlight python %}
@cache_page(60 * 60 * 24)
def autocomplete(request):
    query = ' '.join(request.GET.get('term', '').split()).lower()
    results = Solr(SOLR_URL).search(query)
    ids = [result['id'] for result in results]
    apps = Application.objects(id__in=ids).order_by('name')
    return HttpResponse(json.dumps([{
        'developer': app.developer,
        'icon': app.icon,
        'name': app.name,
        'platform': app.platform,
    } for app in apps]), mimetype='application/json')
{% endhighlight %}

## Notes

I glossed over lots of implementation details that aren't particularly
enlightening. The code presented here isn't exactly what's running
on our site, but it's pretty close.

The autocomplete results could be cached on the client side to
prevent unnecessary roundtrips for repeated queries, but that's a
lot of extra work for a small benefit. Django returns cached pages
pretty quickly.
