title: Haskell Weekly in 2018
---

I run [Haskell Weekly][], a free weekly email newsletter about the Haskell
programming language. At the end of each year I reflect on how things went.
Here's a look at Haskell Weekly in 2018, including popular links, the state of
Haskell survey, and subscriber statistics. You may be interested in comparing
this post with [Haskell Weekly in 2017][] from last year.

## Survey

Haskell Weekly published the second annual state of Haskell survey in 2018. To
the more than 1,300 people that filled it out: Thank you! Your feedback is
valuable for improving the state of Haskell. If you're interested in the
results, please read the [2018 state of Haskell survey results][].

## Subscribers

This graph shows the number of Haskell Weekly subscribers in 2018:

![Haskell Weekly subscribers in 2018][]

At the start of the year, 2,110 people subscribed to Haskell Weekly. Every week
about 17 people subscribed on average. At the end of the year, 3,002 people
were subscribed. Compared to 2017, the rate of new subscribers has slowly a
bit. That being said, I am thrilled to continue to grow my audience without
doing any real marketing our outreach.

## Open rate

This graph shows the open rate of Haskell Weekly subscribers in 2018:

![Haskell Weekly open rate in 2018][]

The open rate stayed relatively constant around 52%, going as low as 49% and as
high as 55%. In 2017 the open rate was trending downward, so I'm happy to see
it stay mostly flat over the course of the year.

## Click rate

This graph shows the click rate of Haskell Weekly subscribers in 2018:

![Haskell Weekly click rate in 2018][]

The click rate stayed relatively constant around 24%, going as low as 20% and
as high as 28%. Like the open rate, I expected the click rate to continue to
fall. I was pleasantly surprised to see it stay about the same instead.
