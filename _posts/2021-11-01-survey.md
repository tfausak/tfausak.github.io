title: 2021 State of Haskell Survey
---

I am excited to announce the [2021 State of Haskell Survey](https://haskellweekly.news/survey/2021.html)!
This is the fifth annual State of Haskell Survey.

The goal of the survey is to better understand what people think of the Haskell programming language, together with its ecosystem and community.
Whether you have never used Haskell or you use it every day, we want to hear from you!

The survey opens today, November 1st, and stays open for two weeks.
It closes on November 15th.

Please take a few minutes to fill out the survey!
We want an accurate picture of the Haskell community,
so please share this link to help us out: <https://haskellweekly.news/survey/2021.html>.
Thanks!
