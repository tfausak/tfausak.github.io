title: Working Remotely

Two summers ago, I interned at [Cisco][1]. I worked in the office
from 9 to 5 every day -- no exceptions. I couldn't stay late, come
in early, or work from home. They were very particular about my
hours. I didn't like that very much. I'm much happier with my current
arrangement at [Famigo][2]. Working for a startup offers a lot of
perks, and one of my favorites is working remotely.

Being able to get out of the office occasionally is important to
me. My girlfriend lives about 200 miles away in Dallas. Traveling
to see her is a piece of cake since I can just work from her
apartment. I set up a desk on one end of her loft so I can do my
thing while she [does hers][3].

Sometimes the weather is just amazing and I want to go for a bike
ride while it's nice out. I can take an hour or two off in the
middle of the day to head down to the lake and tool around on my
bike. When I'm done with my ride, I head back home and finish my
work for the day.

I'm not the only one at Famigo that works remotely. Cody has a baby
to look after, Matt just got married and moved from Chicago, Q flies
around for business, and Shaun helps his fiancée with her research
projects. We all have lives outside of work, and it's nice to be
able to live them during "work hours".

We use a handful of tools to make working from home just as efficient
as working from the office. Of course we use email and phones to
stay in touch, but we also use [Campfire][4] to chat with the whole
group. [Skype][5] lets us do our stand-ups even if we're all standing
in different cities. Laptops and [a remote development environment][6]
mean we're not tied to our desks.
