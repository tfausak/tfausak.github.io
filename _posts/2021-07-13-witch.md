title: Cast Haskell values with Witch

[![][1]][2]

Have you ever wanted to convert a Haskell value from one type to another but
you weren't sure how? Or maybe you did know but you weren't sure if the
conversion was safe. I'm happy to announce [Witch][3], a library that aims to
make those conversions easy and painless. This post will explain my motivation
for creating the library and show some examples of how to use it.

## Motivation

When I'm writing Haskell I feel like I spend a considerable amount of time
converting values between various types. For example I might have an `Int16` on
hand but I want to call a function that expects an `Int`. In that case I would
reach for `fromIntegral` which is maybe the most popular numeric conversion
function.

However what happens when I want to perform the opposite conversion from an
`Int` into an `Int16`? The old reliable `fromIntegral` claims to work for that
but it can give surprising results with no warning. For example weird things
happen when you overflow the target type:

``` hs
>>> fromIntegral (32767 :: Int) :: Int16
32767

>>> fromIntegral (32768 :: Int) :: Int16
-32768
```

This makes `fromIntegral` tricky to use. In some cases it's perfectly safe and
in fact the preferred way to do a conversion. But in other cases it's dangerous
and should be avoided in favor of a safer conversion function. (In this
particular case that function is `toIntegralSized`.)

This same pattern plays out with different types and different type classes all
throughout the Haskell ecosystem. For example `realToFrac` can be idiomatic or
unsafe depending on context. Same with `fromString`.

But let's say these conversion functions are always safe. It can still be
annoying to keep them all in mind and remember when to use them. For instance
the `time` library encourages using `fromIntegral` to produce `NominalDiffTime`
values. That always takes me a few seconds to remember.

## Examples

So how does [Witch][3] help with all this? It provides two type classes: `From`
for conversions that always succeed and `TryFrom` for those that sometimes
fail. It also provides many useful instances and convenient helper functions.
Plus writing new instances is a breeze. Let's take a look!

### Basics

The `From` type class and corresponding `from` method can be used for
conversions that always succeed. A good example of that is what I mentioned
earlier, converting from an `Int16` into an `Int`. Here's how to do that with
[Witch][3]:

``` hs
>>> from (1 :: Int16) :: Int
1
```

Similarly the `TryFrom` type class and `tryFrom` method can be used for
conversions that sometimes fail. Let's try that problematic conversion from
before:

``` hs
>>> tryFrom (32767 :: Int) :: Either (TryFromException Int Int16) Int16
Right 32767

>>> tryFrom (32768 :: Int) :: Either (TryFromException Int Int16) Int16
Left (TryFromException @Int @Int16 32768 Nothing)
```

Huzzah! We accurately captured that the conversion might fail. And when we
tried to perform the conversion it caught the problem for us.

But looking at that example you might have some questions: Do we need all those
type signatures? What if I want it to explode when something goes wrong? Can I
use this with Template Haskell?

### Type Applications

You do not need all those type signatures. The [Witch][3] library is designed
to be used with the `TypeApplications` language extension. That extension makes
it easy to specify the input and output types without having to provide clunky
type signatures. Here are the previous examples with type applications:

``` hs
>>> from @Int16 @Int 1
1

>>> tryFrom @Int @Int16 32767
Right 32767

>>> tryFrom @Int @Int16 32768
Left (TryFromException @Int @Int16 32768 Nothing)
```

### Impure Exceptions

Maybe you want to throw an impure exception when something goes wrong. Perhaps
you know something that you can't prove to the compiler, or maybe you're
writing a quick script and crashing is acceptable. In any case you can use the
unsafe functions in [Witch][3] to do the conversions:

``` hs
>>> unsafeFrom @Int @Int16 32767
32767

>>> unsafeFrom @Int @Int16 32768
*** Exception: TryFromException @Int @Int16 32768 Nothing
```

### Template Haskell

You can use Template Haskell to perform conversions at compile time. The lifted
functions in [Witch][3] make it easy for you:

``` hs
>>> $$( liftedFrom @Int @Int16 32767 )
32767

>>> $$( liftedFrom @Int @Int16 32768 )
<interactive>:2:3: error:
    • Exception when trying to run compile-time code:
        TryFromException @Int @Int16 32768 Nothing
      Code: (liftedFrom @Int @Int16 32768)
    • In the Template Haskell splice $$(liftedFrom @Int @Int16 32768)
      In the expression: $$(liftedFrom @Int @Int16 32768)
      In an equation for ‘it’: it = $$(liftedFrom @Int @Int16 32768)
```

## Conclusion

I tried to keep this post short, which means that I wasn't able to show off
everything that [Witch][3] is able to do. If this sounds interesting to you but
you're wondering about what else it can do, please check out
[the documentation][4] on Hackage. Or if you're curious about how it works
behind the scenes, read [the source][5] on GitHub.

I hope this post helped you understand my motivation for creating [Witch][3].
Please consider using it to handle conversions in your Haskell code, and let me
know if you run into any problems or limitations!
