title: New editor of Haskell Weekly newsletter
---

More than seven years ago, I started a newsletter called [Haskell Weekly](https://haskellweekly.news).
Since then I've edited nearly every issue, with the odd exception for vacations and such.
I'm happy to announce that as of three months ago, [Alexey Zabelin](https://alexeyzabelin.com) has taken over as the editor of the Haskell Weekly newsletter.
Alexey used to contribute the "call for participation" section, so this was a natural progression for him.

I will continue to run the infrastructure and advertising program, but otherwise won't be involved with editorial selections.
Thanks for reading, and please subscribe to the newsletter if you haven't already!
