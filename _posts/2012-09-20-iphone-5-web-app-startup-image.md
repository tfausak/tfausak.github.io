title: iPhone 5 Web App Startup Image
---

![iPhone comparison][1]

I wrote about [icons and startup images for iOS web apps][2] a while
ago. Apple just released the iPhone 5, which is taller than previous
iPhones. Fortunately it's a piece of cake to add iPhone 5-compatible
startup images to a web app.

Unlike native apps, web apps aren't letterboxed. That means old
startup images won't work because they're the wrong resolution. The
iPhone 5 still requests them but it just shows a blank white page
on launch.

So what is the correct resolution? The iPhone 5's screen is 1136
pixels tall and the status bar takes up 40 pixels on retina devices.
That means `640x1096` is the right resolution.

To match the iPhone 5 with media queries, use the reported device
resolution of `320x568`. It also has a `-webkit-device-pixel-ratio`
of `2`, just like all other retina devices.

{% highlight html %}
<link rel="apple-touch-startup-image"
      media="(device-width: 320px)
         and (device-height: 568px)
         and (-webkit-device-pixel-ratio: 2)"
      href="apple-touch-startup-image-640x1096.png">
{% endhighlight %}

## Complete Example

I've created [a minimal web app][3] that includes all icons and
startup images for iOS devices. It's also available [a Gist][4].
Please let me know if you notice any problems or want to suggest
an improvement.

## Notes

I made the media queries overly specific to avoid the problem of
iPhone 5s downloading images and then discarding them. It's possible
to make the media queries a little simpler by only specifying the
`device-height`, but I don't think that optimization is worth it.

Web apps can be letterboxed, but only if their viewport's width is
set to either `device-width` or `320`. To set the proper scale and
avoid letterboxing, set the viewport's initial scale to `1.0`.
(Thanks to [Max Firtman][5] for this solution.)
