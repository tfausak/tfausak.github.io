title: Adios, Famigo! Hello, OrgSync!

![Famigo and OrgSync][1]

Two and a half years ago, I interviewed with Cody from [Famigo][2]
for a summer internship. They had initially reached out to my
brother, but he already had a job and recommended me instead. The
interview went well, but I decided to spend my summer working for
Cisco instead.

When I got back to school in the fall, Cody contacted me and let
me know they were still interested in working with me. I jumped at
the chance to work at a startup after experiencing the other end
of the spectrum. At the time, Famigo had an iOS SDK, so I developed
an iOS game, [Mad Minute][3], to showcase it.

Shortly after joining Famigo, I [dropped out][4] of college for
unrelated reasons. I remember nervously scheduling a meeting with
Cody to break the news to him, unsure of how he'd take it. Turns
out, it wasn't that big of a deal. They were happy to keep me around
and, in fact, brought me on full time.

Not long after that, Famigo pivoted out of the iOS market and into
the Android market. I worked closely with Cody to develop an app
review site from scratch. And both of us worked with Shaun to build
an API for the [Sandbox][5]. It was a great experience to go from
nothing to a complete product.

The next year and a half flew by. Then, in July, [Cody left][6],
leaving me as the de facto senior developer. I never expected to
find myself in that position, especially that early into my career.
Nonetheless, I accepted the promotion and looked forward to the
challenge.

Around the same time, I packed my bags and moved from Austin to
Dallas. I thought the move wouldn't be that big of a deal since I
frequently worked from home. Turns out, telecommuting every day is
actually pretty difficult, especially when the rest of the team is
in the office.

So I started looking for a job in Dallas and quickly found [OrgSync][7].
In spite of the fact that they're a Rails shop and I'm a Django
developer, we seemed like a good fit for each other. I made it
through their interview gauntlet and they offered me a job. I'm
looking forward to working for them, starting on Monday.

That means today is my last day at Famigo. I'm sad to leave. A big
thanks to Cody, Matt, Q, and all the other Famigoans for working
with me over the past two and a half years. It's hard to overstate
just how much fun I've had, how much I've learned, and how much
I've enjoyed working on a great product with such a talented group
of people.
