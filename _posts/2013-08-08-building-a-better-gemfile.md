title: Building a Better Gemfile
---

If you've been hacking on a Rails project for a while, chances are
your Gemfile has spiraled out of control. For instance, the main
OrgSync Gemfile contains 127 gems. That's a ton of dependencies,
and they slow us down. Running `bundle exec rake environment` takes
at least 15 seconds. That might not sound like much, but it adds
up. Think of it as a 15 second tax every time you do anything.

Plus, we don't specify versions for many of the gems. This makes
running `bundle update` downright dangerous, as you could upgrade
to a new major version of a gem. Gems in the asset group, like
CoffeeScript and Sass, were the worst offenders. There's a comment
right above them that says:

> Make sure you perform a full asset precompile on deploy whenever
> you update any of the gems in the following group.

But none of them have any versions specified. You could argue that
that's what `Gemfile.lock` is for. I don't buy that. There's a world
of difference between `gem 'sass'` and `gem 'sass', '~> 3.2.10'`.

## What can be done?

With one simple helper function, you can fix both problems. Drop
this into your Gemfile before any gems:

{% highlight ruby %}
def gem(name, version, options = {})
  if options.has_key?(:require)
    if options[:require].equal?(true)
      options.delete(:require)
    end
  else
    options.merge!(require: false)
  end

  super(name, version, options)
end
{% endhighlight %}

## Happier Developers with Versions

By overwriting the `gem` function and requiring a `version` parameter,
you can be sure you'll never end up with a gem with an unspecified
version. If you try to, `bundle` will blow up at you:

    .../Gemfile:3:in `gem': wrong number of arguments

This has the benefit of making `bundle update` much less risky to
run. Also, it's a lot easier to tell at a glance which versions of
gems your project needs.

## Faster Startup with `require: false`

Instead of eagerly requiring all of your gems, the modified `gem`
function doesn't require them unless you set `require: true`. As a
result, most of your gems won't be available any more. You'll have
to explicitly require them at the top of the file.

As a Pythonista, this doesn't bug me one bit. After all, explicit
is better than implicit. If you still need convincing, consider
this: It got the OrgSync project's startup time down to 12 seconds
(a 20% improvement). And that's not even as fast as it could be ---
43 gems are still eagerly required.
