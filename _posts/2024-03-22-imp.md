title: Announcing Imp, a GHC plugin for automatically importing modules
---

Typically in Haskell you have to import things before you can use them.
This is widely considered to be a good idea.
However sometimes it's convenient to use something without importing it, as long as that thing is unambiguous.
That's what GHCi's [`-fimplicit-import-qualified`][1] flag, which is enabled by default, does for you.
For example the following works in GHCi even if you haven't imported `Data.Tuple`:

``` hs
ghci> Data.Tuple.swap ("world", "hello")
("hello","world")
```

I'm happy to announce [Imp][2], which is a GHC plugin that brings this functionality to regular Haskell modules.
So a module like the following will compile and behave the same as the GHCi example above:

``` hs
{-# OPTIONS_GHC -fplugin=Imp #-}

main :: IO ()
main =
  print $ Data.Tuple.swap ("world", "hello")
```

You can also set up aliases if you want to refer to modules by shorter names.
For example maybe you want `Tuple` to mean `Data.Tuple`.
You can do that with the `--alias=SOURCE:TARGET` option:

``` hs
{-# OPTIONS_GHC
  -fplugin=Imp
  -fplugin-opt=Imp:--alias=Data.Tuple:Tuple #-}

main :: IO ()
main =
  print $ Tuple.swap ("world", "hello")
```

That's about it!
Please check out the [Imp][2] plugin if this sounds interesting to you.
